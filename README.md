# bloc

A fork of my blocklib code from Architecture of Open Source Applications: 500 Lines or Less http://www.aosabook.org/en/500L/blockcode-a-visual-programming-toolkit.html to make this code more easily re-usable and to fix issues like drag-and-drop not working on mobile. Still tiny and relatively comprehensible, the text of the 500 Lines book should still be a good guide to understanding the code.

The goal of this tool is to show how to build a very simple block-based visual programming language suitable for re-use.

Drag-and-drop using the <a href="https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula">Dragula</a> library created by <a href="https://github.com/bevacqua">Nicol√°s Bevacqua</a>.

Some code and much inspiration comes from my own <a href="https://github.com/waterbearlang/waterbear/">Waterbear</a> project, which is a larger and more full-featured tool for block-based code.
